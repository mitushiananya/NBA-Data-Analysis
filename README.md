# NBA Data Analysis

### Read this before you start with the project.

There is no specific order in which you must run the python scripts. But I would recommend the following order:
1. Web Scrape NBA Data
2. Data Analysis NBA 2004 to 2020
3. Stephen Curry Analysis
4. Height and Weight Analysis of NBA Players
5. NBA Simple Shot Chart

#### Please read the .md files of all of the above main files. 

The site from which the majority of the data has been taken is: https://www.basketball-reference.com/
The official NBA site is pretty thorough as well but I prefer Basketball Refernce because of the easy access to information. 

Some of the abbreviations to get acquainted before you start are:

1. Age -- Player's age on February 1 of the season
2. Tm -- Team
3. Lg -- League
4. Pos -- Position
5. G -- Games
6. GS -- Games Started
7. MP -- Minutes Played Per Game
8. FG -- Field Goals Per Game
9. FGA -- Field Goal Attempts Per Game
10. FG% -- Field Goal Percentage
11. 3P -- 3-Point Field Goals Per Game
12. 3PA -- 3-Point Field Goal Attempts Per Game
13. 3P% -- 3-Point Field Goal Percentage
14. 2P -- 2-Point Field Goals Per Game
15. 2PA -- 2-Point Field Goal Attempts Per Game
16. 2P% -- 2-Point Field Goal Percentage
17. eFG% -- Effective Field Goal Percentage. This statistic adjusts for the fact that a 3-point field goal is worth one more point than a 2-point field goal.
18. FT -- Free Throws Per Game
19. FTA -- Free Throw Attempts Per Game
20. FT% -- Free Throw Percentage
21. ORB -- Offensive Rebounds Per Game
22. DRB -- Defensive Rebounds Per Game

24. AST -- Assists Per Game
25. STL -- Steals Per Game
26. BLK -- Blocks Per Game
27. TOV -- Turnovers Per Game
28. PF -- Personal Fouls Per Game
29. PTS -- Points Per Game
